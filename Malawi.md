# An Excersize in Reproducibility and Replicability: Vulnerability and Resilience in Malawi

For this lab, we sought to examine the feasability of reproducing an academic study that used GIS. Reproducibility is critical in GIS studies, and in scientific studies in general. It refers to the ability for someone to read the study and use those same methods to find the same results. Replicability means that the reader can use those same methods and apply it to another geographic location. Reproducibility holds authors accountable to their audience and generates further knowledge and discussion. Unfortunately, true reproducability in scientific studies is extremely rare. Reproducing studies that deal with vulnerability is particularly challenging because there are not good cross-discipline standards for assessing vulnerability. Additionally, indicators of vulnerability vary widely across space and time so replicability is also a challenge. 

Here is Malcolm et al.'s diagram of household resilience:

## The Study

We choose to attempt to reproduce a 2014 called "Vulnerability modeling for sub-Saharan Africa: An operationalized approach in Malawi" by Dylan W. Malcom, et al. This study used a multi-criteria analyses to analyze the drivers of vulnerability at a household level in Malawi with the aim of creating climate-related policy that is specificly tailored to the country's most vulnerable regions. The authors determined a final vulnerability score by combining independently calculated adaptive capacity and livelihood sensitivity scores and subtracting from that a score of physical exposure. They first determined these scores by conducting interviews with members of households regarding their perceptions of climate change, their own capacities to adapt, governance, vulnerability, and foreign aid, among many other topics. They then assessed the relative importance of a large array of factors that contribute to a household's adaptive capacity and sensitivy including but not limited to number of sick people in a house, ownership of a cellphone, and access to food and water. Malcom et al. then normalized each indicator from 0 to 5 to represent the relative condition of a household for that specific variable. They then disaggregated these indicators to the village level and then combined them to assess vulnerability at the Traditional Authorities scale. 

## Reproduction Methodology

### Data
For this lab, we used data from a variety of sources.

* The global flood risk layer from UNEP GLobal Risk Map. We choose to use the global map rather than the one for Malawi because the Malawi one appeared to have incorrect polygons.
* Malawi drought physical exposure layer from UNEP Global Risk Map.
* DHS Cluster Points from the DHS website
* DHS Survey Data from the DHS website
* [FEWSNET Livelihood Zones](http://fews.net/fews-data/335) 
* [Major Lakes](www.masdap.mw/layers/geonode:major_lakes) from Open Street Map, using MASDAP
* [DHS Survey Region boundaries](spatialdata.dhsprogram.com/boundaries/#view=table&countryID=MW) 

We performed our analyses using QGIS Desktop verson 3.8.1 with GRASS 7.6.1. We used CRS WGS 84 (EPSG: 4326).

### Adaptive Capacity: Summarizing DHS Surveys by Traditional Authority

In order to reproduce this complicated first step, we first downloaded the DHS survey metadata and collaboratively extracted the variables that Malcom et al. used in their analyses. We then wrote sql to code these variables into quantiles. First, we had to drop the no data and null values. We had to determine whether 1 or 5 would be the high value depending on the nature of the variable. This proved to be complicated when we were dealing with a binary variable such as cell phone ownership. Below is my map of household resilience followed by that of Malcolm, et al.

### Sensitivity

We were unable to reproduce Malcolm et al.'s sensitivity analyses because we cannot access the data from FewsNET 2005. Our final analyses is therefore only 80% of Malcolm's, with the remaining 20% being a sensitivity analyses. 

### Exposure 

For this part of the analyses we downladed the global data layer from the UNEP website and loaded the layers into POSTGIS with a raster2pgsql command-line program.
