This week, we expanded our work in lab 3 by using a cammand prompt batch process to complete the hydrological workflow for Kilamanjaro, Tanzania. This week however, we used both ASTER and SRTM data and compared the number (error) files in order to determine which data collection system is more accurate for particular landscapes.

First, we mosaicked the DEMS and projected them into the correct coordinate system (UTM Zone 37) from the WGS projection. I then applied a hillshade with azimuth 315 and height 45 in order to better visualize the terrain.
