This week, I sourced data from Open Street Map and Resilience Academy to determine the proportion of each subward in Dar es Salaam that lies in a floodplain.

[Click Here](dsmmap/index.html) to access my leaflet map of Dar es Salaam subwards ranked by the percent of subward area in a floodplain. I've also included a point layer of storm drains for reference.
