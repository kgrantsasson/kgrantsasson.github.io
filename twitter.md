# Twitter Hotpost Analysis: Tweets During Hurican Dorian 

For our final lab of the semester, we learned how to access Twitter data through their API platform, execute a query for particular words, and perform a spatial analysis of these queried tweets. Accessing this information throught the Twitter API is particularly powerful because we can get tweets in real time. However, spatial analysis of Twitter data can be difficult becuase only about 1% of all tweets have their geo-location enabled. Twitter solves this problem by generalizing the tweets to their respective neighborhood, city, or sometimes country, depending on what invormation the user has provided in her profile or her settings. In this lab, we sought to determine whether people in regions impacted by Hurricane Dorian (or thought to be impacted- see "Sharpiegate") tweeted more during Dorian than on average during the month of November. 

## Methods

### Data Sources

1. Twitter data, accessed using 











In this age of big data, spatial scientists have unprecendented access to information on anything from public sentiment, to natural hazard vulnerability and response. Being able to access this huge wealth of information can be overwhelming and because if its relative novelty, the standards for big data mining have not be fully developed or widely accepted.
