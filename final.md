# Georeferencing Historical Lincoln

For my final project, I georeferenced a historical map of Lincoln, Vermont and digitized the river system. Georeferencing involves assigning real-world coordinates to a non-geolocated image in order to locate the map extent of the image in space.

[Click Here](/finalmap/index.html) to check out my leaflet map. Toggle the list of layers on the right to view the Open Street Map baselayer, the clipped hisotical map of Lincoln, the current river data from VCGI, and the digitized river set from the historical map.
